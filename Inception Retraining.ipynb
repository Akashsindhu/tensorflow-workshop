    "# Inception script: a boring but effective solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Google was kind enough to provide a pre-built script to retrain Inception on our own classification tasks automatically. Two things to take away:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It works really well, and is great for all manner of professional uses\n",
    "2. Doing it automatically is boring and skips some important lessons about doing it on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there are definitely important patterns to learn- check out the [official how-to here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html) and the script we're using [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py)."
